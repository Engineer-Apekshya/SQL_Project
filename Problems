Here are the problems that we will be solving using SQL commands.

Q1. Group the job by title and count number of jobs, their minimim, maximum and average salary
and display them in order with maximum job counts.
Ans.
SELECT job_title_short AS jobs,
	COUNT(job_title_short) AS job_count,
	AVG(salary_year_avg) as average_salary,
 	MIN(salary_year_avg) as minimum_salary,
	MAX(salary_year_avg) as maximum_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
GROUP BY jobs
HAVING job_count > 100
ORDER BY job_count DESC

Q2. Count total jobs which provides health insurance in the column job_health_insurance
Ans.
SELECT COUNT(job_health_insurance) as insurance_count
FROM job_postings_fact
WHERE job_health_insurance = TRUE

Q3. Count total jobs available in each country from column job_country
SELECT job_country, COUNT(job_title_short) as jobs_count
FROM job_postings_fact
GROUP BY job_country

JOINS
LEFT JOIN
Q3. We have one table named job_posting_facts and another table company_dim, where both of the table
have company_id column, now use left join and return company_id and job_title from left table and company_id
and name from right table
Ans
SELECT job_posting.company_id, job_posting.job_title, job_location, companies.company_id, companies.name
FROM job_postings_fact AS job_posting
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS companies ON job_posting.company_id = companies.company_id

RIGHT JOIN
Q4. Lets do Right join in same above example and try to understand
Ans
SELECT job_posting.company_id, job_posting.job_title, job_location, companies.company_id, companies.name
FROM job_postings_fact AS job_posting
RIGHT JOIN company_dim AS companies ON job_posting.company_id = companies.company_id
Note: Usage, for example if right table companies_dim had more company_id than  left table then in final result
there will be all company_id table from right table

INNER JOIN
Returns intersection or common data between two tables
Q5. We have following tables,
	table A and B have company_id in common,
	table A and D have job_id in common,
	table C and D have skills_id in common
A*Jobs Fact Table with columns 
	job_id
	company_id
	job_title_short
	job_title
	job_location
	job_via
	job_schedule_type
	job_work_from_home
	search_location
	job_posted_date
	job_no_degree_mention
	job_health_insurance
	job_country
	salary_rate
	salary_year_avg
	salary_hour_avg
B*Company Dim Table with columns
	company_id
	name
	link
	link_google
	thumbnail
C*Skills Dim Table with columns 
	skill_id
	skills
	type
D*Skill-Job Dim Table with columns
       	job_id
	skill_id

Now return job_id, job_title form table A skill_id from from table D and skills from table C

Ans.
SELECT 
	job_postings.job_id, 
	job_postings.job_title,
	skills_to_job.skill_id,
   	 skills.skills
FROM job_postings_fact AS job_postings
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skills_to_job ON job_postings.job_id = skills_to_job.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS skills ON skills_to_job.skill_id = skills.skill_id

Here are the problems that we will be solving using SQL commands.

Q1. Group the job by title and count number of jobs, their minimim, maximum and average salary
and display them in order with maximum job counts.
Ans.
SELECT job_title_short AS jobs,
	COUNT(job_title_short) AS job_count,
	AVG(salary_year_avg) as average_salary,
 	MIN(salary_year_avg) as minimum_salary,
	MAX(salary_year_avg) as maximum_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
GROUP BY jobs
HAVING job_count > 100
ORDER BY job_count DESC

Q2. Count total jobs which provides health insurance in the column job_health_insurance
Ans.
SELECT COUNT(job_health_insurance) as insurance_count
FROM job_postings_fact
WHERE job_health_insurance = TRUE

Q3. Count total jobs available in each country from column job_country
SELECT job_country, COUNT(job_title_short) as jobs_count
FROM job_postings_fact
GROUP BY job_country

JOINS
LEFT JOINS
Q3. We have one table named job_posting_facts and another table company_dim, where both of the table
have company_id column, now use left join and return company_id and job_title from left table and company_id
and name from right table
Ans
SELECT job_posting.company_id, job_posting.job_title, job_location, companies.company_id, companies.name
FROM job_postings_fact AS job_posting
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS companies ON job_posting.company_id = companies.company_id

RIGHT JOINS
Q3. Lets do Right join in same above example and try to understand
Ans
SELECT job_posting.company_id, job_posting.job_title, job_location, companies.company_id, companies.name
FROM job_postings_fact AS job_posting
RIGHT JOIN company_dim AS companies ON job_posting.company_id = companies.company_id
Note: Usage, for example if right table companies_dim had more company_id than  left table then in final result
there will be all company_id table from right table

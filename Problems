Here are the problems that we will be solving using SQL commands.

Q. Group the job by title and count number of jobs, their minimim, maximum and average salary
and display them in order with maximum job counts.

SELECT job_title_short AS jobs,
	COUNT(job_title_short) AS job_count,
	AVG(salary_year_avg) as average_salary,
  MIN(salary_year_avg) as minimum_salary,
  MAX(salary_year_avg) as maximum_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
GROUP BY jobs
HAVING job_count > 100
ORDER BY job_count DESC
